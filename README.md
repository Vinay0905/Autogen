# 🤖 AutoGen Basics – My First Steps into Agentic AI

This repository documents my beginner-friendly journey into **[AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)** – a powerful framework by Microsoft for building **multi-agent conversational AI systems**.

I've explored and tested simple agent setups using multiple backends like:

- 🔹 OpenAI API
- 🔹 Azure AI (Foundry)
- 🔹 Anthropic (experimental)
- 🔹 Gemini (experimental)
- 🔹 Ollama (experimental)
- 🔹 Llama API (experimental)
- 🔹 Semantic Kernel Adapter

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `basic_chat/` | Simple agent-to-agent conversation using OpenAI |
| `multi_backend_test/` | Test runs using alternative backends like Gemini, Ollama, etc. |
| `configs/` | Basic config examples for agent and system settings |
| `README.md` | You're reading it! |

## 🚧 What's Next?

I'm currently:
- Learning to build **multi-agent task solving setups**
- Exploring **tool usage** and **custom agent behaviors**
- Planning to integrate this with real-world APIs for agent workflows

Stay tuned! I’ll be regularly updating this repo with new experiments, ideas, and project-level setups.
